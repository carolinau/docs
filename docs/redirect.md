# Redirect
Applies to:
- [carolinau.edu](https://carolinau.edu)
- [e4.carolinau.edu](https://e4.carolinau.edu)

## Overview
The [Redirect](https://www.drupal.org/project/redirect), Redirect 404, and Redirect Domain modules are used extensively on the main website to direct visitors to the correct pages when dealing with outdated links throughout the university and on the internet, and to deal with constantly updating file URLs.

## Adding and Managing Redirects
Navigate to /admin/config/search/redirect in order to view all current redirects and add new ones. When adding, pay close attention to the lack of a leading backslash (/) on the source path, and the inclusion of a leading backslash on the to path (for internal links). For most applications, the redirect status should be set to 301.
