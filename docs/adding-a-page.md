# Adding a Page
To create a new page, select **Content** from the [admin toolbar](/the-admin-toolbar.md) and click the blue **+ Add content** button. You’ll see a list of all the available content types on the given site. For carolinau.edu, there are two primary content types for page creation: *Basic page* and *Standard page*. *Basic page* is equipped with the [Paragraphs]( /content-updates.md) module, allowing for flexible customization of the design and layout, while *Standard page* has a text header or header with an image, a content block, a call to action section, and a block field.

For all the microsites, you will only find the *Basic page* content type.

The purpose of having two primary content types on carolinau.edu is for search capabilities. Content in Paragraph blocks is not indexible by the search plugin used on the website (Solr), while content in a standard [node](/terms.md) or in the *Standard page* is indexible by Solr. *Standard page* should be used whenever the design is simple and indexable content is of high priority, but a *Basic page* should be used when a complex layout is required.

## Standard Page
Once you’ve selected *Standard page*, begin filling out the fields. At minimum you need a title and content of some form on the page.
