## Site Structure
> Microsite: a school-specific site containing programs, program courses, courses, and school faculty.  

The main website, piedmontu.edu, serves as the primary destination for all traffic. Each microsite contains all the programs and minors within that school, the faculty members of that school, and any other information that the Dean chooses to place on that site.

piedmontu.edu houses all the other information not related to any specific school. This includes admissions, financial services, student life, and all academic information including a master list of all the academic programs. The **programs** page links to all the programs and concentrations on the microsites.

## Microsite Purpose
One of the purposes of the microsites was to try out development on Drupal before going all-in on the platform. But the greater purpose behind the microsites is to reduce the information load on the main site and distribute traffic between the schools. All the microsites are built on separate codebases to allow for advanced functionality on sites that demand it.
