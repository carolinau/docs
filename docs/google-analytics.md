# Google Analytics
Google Analytics is the analytics software installed on each of the websites. Each website gets its own Google Analytics property, under the main PIU Analytics account. To manage Google Analytics on a site, navigate to the Google Analytics module via the configuration admin menu item. Most of the settings present don’t need adjustments, except for the Web Property ID.

The Web Property ID is the number that Google Analytics gives you to identify a specific website. You don’t need to copy the entire block of code that Google gives you; only the ID starting with **UA-**. This number gets pasted into the ID number field on the Drupal website.

To view Google Analytics data, navigate to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)  and select the desired property (website) under the Piedmont International University analytics account. If you don’t have access and need access to the analytics data, contact the Webmaster.

When adding a new property, follow this naming standard:
Property Name = Site Name
View Name = Site URL
