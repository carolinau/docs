# Google Analytics
Google Analytics is the analytics software installed on each of the websites. Each website shares the same carolinau.edu Google Analytics property, under the main CU Analytics account. Google Analytics is implemented via the Google Tag Manager Module.

To view Google Analytics data, navigate to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)  and select the desired property (website) under the Carolina University analytics account. If you donâ€™t have access and need access to the analytics data, contact the Webmaster.
