# Design Principles
> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” — Steve Jobs  

The Piedmont International University network of websites are designed with these principles in mind:

- Simplicity
- Accessibility
- Hierarchy
- Unity

## Simplicity
Simplicity comes down to presenting the information in a way that is not overwhelming. This is most evident in the navigation of the main website: all the dropdowns only have one level. Simplicity is about using design techniques such as color, size, icons, to present information or tell the user that it is an action using only design.

Take for example the program-level links on the academic programs page. You could say “Go to Undergraduate,” but that wouldn’t be simple. By making the text bigger and using double down arrows, the design conveys to the user that by clicking on that link they’ll jump to the undergraduate programs. Notice also that the double down arrows aren’t used anywhere else on the site. If they were a single down arrow, it may convey a dropdown menu. If it was a right arrow, it would convey a new page. Design must be consistent.

## Accessibility
Drupal is, out of the box, very accessible. This website is built to meet WCAG 2.0 standards. Read more about the standard at [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). All the content blocks on the websites are built with these standards in mind, so as long as they are used as designed the site will remain compliant.

## Hierarchy
Hierarchy is not just limited to the menus. It’s about understanding the flow of how a user navigates a website, and shaping the design around that. Take for example tuition and fees. A potential student coming to the website would be very interested in the tuition and fees, but since we are dealing with undergraduate, graduate, and dual enrollment fees, we need to separate them onto separate pages. Without presenting the user a very large first-level navigation menu, we allow the user to drill down into the information they need. The flow looks like this:

Financial Services > Tuition & Fees > Undergraduate

By structuring the pages this way, it ensures that the user is not overwhelmed with information or with options, and allows them to drill down to the information they need one level at a time. 

Hierarchy is also used on each page. Many of the pages start with a **featured image header**, which is the image to the left of the page title, teaser text, and call to action button. They also may start with a **heading with divider** paragraph. Generally, these two should be used only at the start of the page. 

Moving on from the header, the rest of the page should be separated using a variety of intentional content blocks. **Colored CTAs** are used to highlight short, actionable pieces of information. **Content** should be used for the basic content of each page.
